# 🔍 Binary Search Problems – Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet (TUF)

This repository contains C++ solutions to all the **Binary Search** problems listed in the "Searching" section of [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet/). Each program is implemented with clean, optimized logic — including binary search in arrays, on the answer space, and in various application-based problems.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Basic Binary Search (Iterative and Recursive)
- ✅ First and Last Occurrence of Element
- ✅ Count Occurrences of a Number
- ✅ Lower Bound / Upper Bound
- ✅ Search Insert Position
- ✅ Square Root using Binary Search
- ✅ Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- ✅ Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- ✅ Peak Element in Array
- ✅ Binary Search in 2D Matrix
- ✅ Allocation-based Problems (Book Allocation, Aggressive Cows, etc.)
- ✅ Binary Search on Answer Technique

Each file contains:

- Brute force solutions first
- Thereafter, Optimal C++ solution
- Clean code with proper naming

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NishantMishra31/Searching.git
   cd Searching
   ```

2. **Compile Any File**
   ```bash
   g++ 01_binary_search.cpp -o run
